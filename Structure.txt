Tags/Labels: Organize tasks using tags or labels for easy filtering and searching.

User Interface:

Task List View: Display all tasks in a list format, often with options to filter and sort them.

Responsive Design: Ensure the app works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. (NOT NOW)

User Accounts:

Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and log in to access their personalized task lists.
User Data Management: Store and retrieve user data securely to maintain personalized task lists.
Notifications and Reminders:

Task Reminders: Notify users about upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks via email or push notifications.
Recurring Tasks: Allow users to set tasks to repeat at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
Additional Features:
Collaboration:

Shared Lists: Enable users to share task lists with others for collaborative projects.
Assign Tasks: Allow users to assign tasks to specific individuals within a shared list.
Integration:

Calendar Integration: Sync tasks with calendar applications to visualize deadlines and schedules.
Third-Party Integrations: Integrate with other productivity tools like project management apps, note-taking apps, or communication platforms.
Customization:

Themes and Layouts: Provide options to customize the appearance of the app.
Custom Task Fields: Allow users to add custom fields to tasks for additional information.
Implementation in PHP:
For a procedural PHP to-do list app, the following components would typically be involved:

Front-End:

HTML/CSS for the user interface.
JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., adding and marking tasks as complete without reloading the page).
Back-End:

PHP scripts to handle user requests (e.g., add, edit, delete tasks).
MySQL or another database to store task information and user data.
Basic Example Structure:
Database:

Tables for users, tasks, and possibly tags or categories.
PHP Scripts:

index.php: Main page displaying the task list.
add_task.php: Script to handle adding a new task.
edit_task.php: Script to handle editing an existing task.
delete_task.php: Script to handle deleting a task.
complete_task.php: Script to mark a task as complete.
login.php and register.php: Scripts for user authentication.
Forms and UI:

HTML forms for task input and user registration/login.
Lists to display tasks, with options to filter by categories, due dates, or completion status.
This gives a comprehensive overview of what a to-do list app is and how it can be structured and implemented using procedural PHP.
